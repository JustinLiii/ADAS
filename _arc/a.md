'}, {'role': 'user', 'content': '# Your Task:
You will be given some number of paired example inputs and outputs grids. The outputs were produced by applying a transformation rule to the input grids. In addition to the paired example inputs and outputs, there is also one test input without a known output.
The inputs and outputs are each "grids". A grid is a rectangular matrix of integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive). Each number corresponds to a color. 0 is black.
Your task is to determine the transformation rule from examples and find out the answer, involving determining the size of the output grid for the test and correctly filling each cell of the grid with the appropriate color or number.

The transformation only needs to be unambiguous and applicable to the example inputs and the test input. It doesn\'t need to work for all possible inputs. Observe the examples carefully, imagine the grid visually, and try to find the pattern.
## Examples:

### Example 0:
input = [[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0],[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0],[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]]
output = [[2,2,2],[8,8,8],[3,3,3]]

### Example 1:
input = [[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[0,5,5,0,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]]
output = [[3,3,3],[4,4,4],[2,2,2]]

### Example 2:
input = [[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5],[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5]]
output = [[8,8,8],[2,2,2],[4,4,4]]

### Example 3:
input = [[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,0,5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5]]
output = [[2,2,2],[4,4,4],[2,2,2]]

## Test Problem:
Given input:
 [[5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5],[5,5,5,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5],[5,0,0,5,0,0,5,5,0,0,5,0,0,5],[5,0,0,5,0,5,5,5,5,0,5,5,5,5]]
 
 Analyze the transformation rules based on the provided Examples and determine what the output should be for the Test Problem.
 
 # Instruction: 
 Please think step by step and then solve the task by writing the code.
 
 You will write code to solve this task by creating a function named `transform`. This function should take a single argument, the input grid as `list[list[int]]`, and returns the transformed grid (also as `list[list[int]]`). You should make sure that you implement a version of the transformation that works for both example and test inputs. Make sure that the transform function is capable of handling both example and test inputs effectively, reflecting the learned transformation rules from the Examples inputs and outputs.
